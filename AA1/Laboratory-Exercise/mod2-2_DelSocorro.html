			<h1>Orange</h1>
			<p>Orange is a high school drama which is friendship-centered with a little bit of romance among the main characters. Naho Takamiya, stumbles upon a letter from herself 10 years into the future that tells her to watch over the new transferee student, Kakeru Naruse who eventually became part of her circle of friends. The magical letters accurately predict events and help her to prevent her "biggest regrets" which is connected to Kakeru. Orange, in general tackles about how depression could lead into something dreadful especially to one's life and how it is burdening to keep problems with oneself; however, despite its dark side, it emphasizes the true meaning of friendship, that friends will always be there to look out for you whenever you are down.  </p>
