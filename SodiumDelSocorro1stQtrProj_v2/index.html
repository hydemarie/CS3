						athe country's financial situation was one of the leading contributors to the escalating schooling problems in the Philippines. More children, adolescents, and adults are falling behind due to unequal access to educational opportunities. 
						 In fact, the nation had already been identified as one of those with declining learning curves.</p>

						whereas many teens do not. It is essential to comprehend the importance of education and the potential consequences of not acquiring it. 
						Now we will analyze in depth the current situation and the methods in which we might participate in social activities to tackle these significant difficulties facing our nation.</p>
