						<h2 id="myCause">What are the root causes?</h2>
						<p>Private schools are more accessible to Filipinos from affluent households or from urban and developed areas. In contrast, disadvantaged people are more likely to face a lack of classrooms, teachers, and resources to sustain high-quality education. 
						The lack of schools is a contributing aspect. School is much more than a physical structure where instruction takes place. In addition to students, teachers, and instructional materials, a school consists of all the other components of an education system. 
						However, all of this costs money. The economic situation of the Philippines does not allow for the construction of sufficient schools to provide children with the essential education. 
						Consequently, the economic condition is the primary reason why children are compelled to battle for existence at a young age, preventing them from receiving an education. 
						Child labor is one of the leading reasons of lack of education because many families lack even the means to meet their most basic needs, requiring their children to begin working at a young age. 
						Furthermore, individuals of ethnic and other minorities, as well as children with disabilities, are frequently the subject of prejudice, making it more challenging for them to obtain an education compared to other groups. </p>

						<h2 id="myEffect">What are the detrimental effects?</h2>
						<p>Negative consequences of the lack of education or inadequate instruction are numerous and varied, and can impact both the life of an individual, and society as a whole. 
						They range from health-related reasons, social, and economic reasons, each of them generating serious consequence. 
						The longer a person or a community is cut off from education, the more severe, long-term and irreversible the effects become. Due to adverse life circumstances, many people lack the tools and means that would enable them to leave poverty behind. 
						Education is precisely what provides a person with these tools and means, but in poor communities and countries, it either does not exist at all, or if it does, it is inadequate, and this is how people find themselves in the vicious circle of poverty from which they cannot free themselves. 
						The fact is that the more educated a person is, the better their chances of a decent salary. Moreover, unemployment is tightly linked to poverty. 
						People who lack education, or who only finished primary school often work poorly paid jobs, or struggle to find any job whatsoever. 
						Simply put, good jobs are reserved for qualified employees, and qualifications are primarily acquired through education.  Uneducated people struggle to fit in social situations, and often remain marginalized. 
						Furthermore, the lack of resources generated by education prevents them from participating in numerous social activities in a productive and comprehensive way, in contrast to educated people who engage in the same activities without difficulty.   </p>

						<h2 id="mySolution">Vision for a Quality Education</h2>
						<p>Of course, any country would want to build and keep a standard vision for its learning system: one that promotes cultural diversity; is free from bias; offers a safe space and respect for human rights; and forms traits, skills, and talent among others.
						With the countryâ€™s efforts to address the growing concerns, one key program that is set to come out is the education with efforts to focus on honing skills, including technical and vocational ones. In times of crises and sudden changes, having access to education should be valued. 
						Aside from the fact that it is a main human right, it also impacts the other human rights that we have. When learning systems break, having a sustained state will be far from happening. It may be hard to solve the education problem overnight,
						but all sectors must work together to improve the quality of education.<br>
						
						<br>The government must step up efforts to give out-of-school kids with skills-based learning opportunities, as well as boost early childhood care and development programs,
						promote full implementation of the K-12 system, continue curricular reforms, and make measures to improve the quality of teachers and educators.
						Attracting renowned professors and researchers, as well as encouraging excellence in higher education institutions, are examples. 
						Furthermore, funding should be increased to assist schools in developing modules, worksheets,
						and DepEd-approved study materials to help individuals, who cannot easily obtain digital tools, acquire knowledge at a time when technology is increasing and advancing.</p>
