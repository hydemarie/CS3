		<h1> Create a brighter future together,
		for the youth and children of our nation.</h1>
		<p> Poverty is the main obstacle for many young people in the Philippines.
		Due to a lack of resources, many students cannot complete their education that will make it 
		impossible for them to attend school and acquire good-paying job.
		In addition, a lot of children' parents compel them to work and drop out of school because of poverty.</p>
		<P>No child asks to be born into poverty.They also have little control over where they are raised, 
		which may be in areas without access to clean water
		or a conflict area or without medical personnel and educators.
		Thus, let's raise awareness of several concerns impacting children globally, including in the Philippines.
		We need each other to succeed. Here is where you step in.</p>
