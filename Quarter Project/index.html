				<h2> Speak out for Children </h2>
				<p>The Philippines is one of only five nations in the world that has not yet implemented face-to-face instruction, 
				affecting the right to education of over 27 million Filipino pupils.
				Even before the COVID-19 outbreak caused problems for millions of families, 
				the country's financial situation was one of the leading contributors to the 
				escalating schooling problems in the Philippines. More children, adolescents, 
				and adults are falling behind due to unequal access to educational opportunities. 
				In fact, the nation had already been identified as one of those with declining 
				learning curves.</p>
				
				<p>In the future, these issues may have far more severe repercussions. 
				Growing up, many people feel that education is endless and that everyone has easy access; 
				however, not having a proper education can have severe consequences for a person. 
				In addition, many adults who have access to education take it for granted,
				whereas many teens do not. It is essential to comprehend the importance of education 
				and the potential consequences of not acquiring it. 
				Now we will analyze in depth the current situation and the methods in which we might 
				participate in social activities to tackle these significant difficulties facing our nation.</p>
